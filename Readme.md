# LushCoin
Development is still in the early stages.
Do read the LushCoin white paper to know where this is going; its in the Docs folder.

## Beta of Concept Hasher
The core of the AI component, a module that can create unique cryptographic hashes per concept (concept hasher) has been largely completed.

The beta component will initially be open only to sections of the open source and allied communities that are globally recognised as leading. For a bit more detail, see the Beta section at http://mindmutiny.com/lushcoin.html#beta (you really should read the page from the top though).
