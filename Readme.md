# LushCoin
Development is still in the early stages.
Do read the LushCoin white paper to know where this is going; its in the Docs folder.

## Beta of Concept Hasher
The core of the AI component, a module that can create unique cryptographic hashes per concept (concept hasher) has been largely completed.
This beta date of this component was previously announced on bitcointalk.org (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1857322.msg19649439) as 26th of June 2017. That date has been moved to the 30th of June due to unforeseen circumstances.

The beta component will be open to sections of the open source and allied communities that are globally recognised as leading.
